            <p id="Paragraph">I haven't had professional experience at this point within my career.
            This is due to the fact that I am still at the transition stages of moving to university from college (sixth form).
            However, I have had previous work at McDonalds and Tesco.
            Although these don't involve IT skills and merely involve the use of IT systems within these jobs, they do provide life skills that are transferable to the workplace.

            <br>
            Within workloads focusing on agile methodologies, teamwork and leadership skills are essential to maintain a healthly outlook on work and the impact of teamwork.
            These positions in retail and catering have given me one of the most important skills within a professional profile; being able to talk and converse with people.
            These skills enable me to work closely with clients and be able to present ideas to large crowds / audiences.
