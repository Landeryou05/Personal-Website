This website is just a simple project that shows my basic understanding of HTML and CSS with no JavaScript usage.

I want to develop website development skills (both front-end and back-end), and it is my ambition to create projects with a JavaScript framework, such as React.JS in the near future.

Besides website development, I want to experience different programming languages, such as C++ and enhancing my .NET skills with C#.
